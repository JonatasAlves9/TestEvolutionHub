# TestEvolutionHub

Welcome to TestEvolutionHub, a repository dedicated to tracking my journey of improvement in the field of software testing. This repository covers testing in frontend, mobile, and backend development, offering insights into my ongoing growth in this field.

## About the Repository

In this repository, you'll find an organized structure for different development areas:

- **Frontend:** Projects related to testing user interfaces and frontend logic.
- **Mobile:** Projects focused on testing mobile applications on different platforms.
- **Backend:** Projects related to testing APIs, services, and server-side functionalities.

Each subdirectory contains individual projects that showcase testing approaches, implementations, and relevant technologies. The intention is to document my progress over time and share knowledge with the community.

## How to Navigate

Feel free to explore the subdirectories that align with your interests:

- In **Frontend**, you'll find projects addressing component testing, interactions, and user flows.
- In **Mobile**, there are projects that concentrate on testing mobile applications across different platforms.
- In **Backend**, the projects demonstrate how to conduct tests for APIs, services, and server-side features.

Each subdirectory will have its own set of instructions and resources for reproduction and learning.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily centered around my own progress, I would appreciate constructive feedback and suggestions from the community. Feel free to open issues to discuss enhancements, corrections, or to share ideas related to the projects presented here.

Thank you for following my journey of evolution in software testing!
